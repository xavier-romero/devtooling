The idea of this role is that we use all of the random test contracts
that we have that aren't automated. There are a few that are left out
because they're more specifc.

- The prover killers are in a different role
- ~gas-refund-sstore.lisp~ this one needs to be deliberately called twice with input
- ~huge-contract.lisp~ because this is more for static input and will
  cause issues depending on the max argument size of bash
- ~return-variable-sized-contract.lisp~ redundant
- ~selfdestruct-calldata-target.lisp~ tested in a different role
- ~geth-test*~ are in a different role as well

#+begin_src bash
find files/ -maxdepth 1 -type f -name '*.deploy.bin' | xargs -I xxx basename xxx | sort > current-tests.txt
find ~/code/jhilliard/evm-testing/out/ -maxdepth 1 -type f -name '*.deploy.bin' | xargs -I xxx basename xxx | sort > all-tests.txt
diff -y current-tests.txt all-tests.txt
#+end_src


Some other features we should add:
- LOG Weirdness with uneven sizes
- A contract that will dynamically expand the code sized based on the
  constructor
